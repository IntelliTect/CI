To update the website with new product data

1. Update th DI Comaprison Chart.xlsx accordingly.  If there are images, put them into the 'products' folder and reference them in the .xlsx by the image name without the products path (e.g. "image.png")

2. Run "RefreshWebsite.bat". You will need the .NET Framework 4.6.2 installed; if it is not it will prompt you for installation. 

3. The only file modified will be data.js - check that in and the new data will be reflected on the website within a few minutes.
